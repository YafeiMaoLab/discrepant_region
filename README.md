# discrepant_region

Visualization of the 238 large discrepant regions between CHM13 and GRCh38.
This includes the screeenshots of the discrepant regions from saffire and dotplot.

SynPlotter is designed to visualize the syntenic relationship of a region between the GRCh38 and CHM13_T2T human genome assembly. SynPlotter is an integrated visualization tool from our custom scripts, Mummer4 (https://github.com/mummer4/mummer) , and SAFFIRE (https://github.com/mrvollger/SafFire).
